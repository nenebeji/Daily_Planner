## Description
The aim of this project was to create a simple calender application allowing a user to save events for each hour.

* When a user opens the daily planner, the current day, date and time is displayed at the top of the page.

* When a user scrolls down, the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
* * Each time block is colour coded to indicate whether it's past(grey), present(red) and future(green).

* A user can click into each timeblock and enter an event.

* A user can save each event to local storage by clicking on the save button next to each timeblock.

* When a user refereshes the page, the saved events persists.

### Problems Solved

* First made sure all the classes in the html matched the classes in the css.

* Created a storeItem() in js for storing each event in the local storage on.click.

* Added data attribute: data-time to each time block to enable specific selection in js.

* Selected the data-time attr in js and selected specific section to add colour: this took some time but eventually figured it out, after several trial and errors.
